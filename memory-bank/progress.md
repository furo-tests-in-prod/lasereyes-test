# Progress: Methane

## What Works

### Frontend

1. **Next.js Application**:
   - Modern React framework with TypeScript
   - Component-based architecture
   - Improved development workflow

2. **UI Implementation**:
   - Responsive layout with Tailwind CSS
   - Gas bubble animation
   - Fee rate adjustment functionality
   - Wallet connection and disconnection
   - Improved component structure

3. **Wallet Integration**:
   - LaserEyes SDK integration with provider pattern
   - Wallet connection detection via useLaserEyes hook
   - Address retrieval and display
   - TypeScript interfaces for wallet interaction

4. **Transaction Flow**:
   - Button state changes based on wallet connection
   - Loading states during connection and minting
   - Fee rate selection and validation
   - Structured API client for backend communication
   - Mock implementation fallbacks for testing without a fully compatible wallet

### Backend

1. **Server Setup**:
   - Express server implementation
   - API endpoint for PSBT creation
   - CORS and body-parser middleware
   - Enhanced logging with morgan
   - Environment variable configuration with dotenv
   - Improved error handling and validation

2. **Mock Implementation**:
   - Simplified mock implementation of PSBT creation
   - Documentation of how the real implementation would work
   - Better error handling and logging

## What's Left to Build

### Frontend

1. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Replace alert dialogs with proper UI components for notifications
   - Add transaction history and status tracking
   - Enhance mobile responsiveness
   - Add loading indicators and progress feedback

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement error boundaries in React components
   - Create a centralized error handling system
   - Improve error reporting and user feedback

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement code splitting and lazy loading
   - Optimize bundle size
   - Add caching strategies

### Backend

1. **Real SDK Integration**:
   - Replace the mock implementation with actual OYL SDK integration
   - Implement proper PSBT creation for the Alkanes protocol
   - Add comprehensive error handling for SDK operations

2. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add authentication for API requests
   - Enhance input validation
   - Add request sanitization

3. **Production Readiness**:
   - Enhance logging and monitoring
   - Add health checks and metrics
   - Implement graceful shutdown
   - Add request validation middleware

### Testing

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - React component tests with React Testing Library
   - API client tests
   - Backend service tests

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - End-to-end tests for the complete minting flow
   - Error handling tests
   - Edge case testing

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD setup
   - Automated testing
   - Deployment automation
   - Environment-specific configurations

## Current Status

The project has progressed from a prototype to a **development stage**. The application has been significantly improved with a modern architecture and better code organization, but still requires further enhancements before production readiness:

1. **Frontend**: Migrated to Next.js with TypeScript and improved component structure
2. **Backend**: Enhanced server implementation with better logging and error handling, but still using mock SDK integration
3. **Wallet Integration**: Improved with LaserEyes provider pattern and TypeScript interfaces
4. **Development Workflow**: Enhanced with better tooling and scripts
5. **Testing**: Added mock implementations for wallet functionality to enable testing without a fully compatible wallet, but still lacking automated tests

## Known Issues

### Frontend Issues

1. **Alert Dialogs**: The application uses browser alert dialogs instead of proper UI components
2. **Error Handling**: While improved, error handling could be more comprehensive
3. **Performance**: No optimization strategies implemented yet
4. **Accessibility**: Needs accessibility improvements for better user experience

### Backend Issues

1. **Mock Implementation**: The mock implementation doesn't create valid PSBTs for the Alkanes protocol
2. **Security**: No rate limiting or authentication implemented
3. **Input Validation**: Could be more comprehensive
4. **Error Handling**: Could be more structured and consistent

### Integration Issues

1. **Transaction Confirmation**: No mechanism to track transaction confirmation status
2. **Fee Rate Estimation**: No dynamic fee rate estimation based on network conditions
3. **Environment Configuration**: Environment variables need better documentation and validation

## Next Milestone

The next milestone is to replace the mock implementation with the actual OYL SDK integration, which will enable real minting of Methane tokens. This involves:

1. Implementing the actual SDK integration in `oyl-sdk-integration.js`
2. Adding proper error handling and validation for SDK operations
3. Testing the integration with the OYL wallet
4. Verifying that transactions are properly formatted for the Alkanes protocol
5. Confirming successful minting on the Bitcoin network
6. Adding transaction status tracking and history

Following this, the focus will shift to:

1. Replacing alert dialogs with proper UI components
2. Implementing comprehensive testing
3. Enhancing security features
4. Optimizing performance
5. Preparing for production deployment
