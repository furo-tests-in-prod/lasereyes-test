# Active Context: Methane

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on improving the Methane application through a significant architectural upgrade. The project has been migrated from a Parcel-based setup to Next.js with TypeScript, which provides better structure, type safety, and developer experience.

1. **Frontend Implementation**: A Next.js application with TypeScript and React components, using the LaserEyes SDK for wallet connection and transaction signing.

2. **Backend Implementation**: An Express server with a mock implementation of the OYL SDK integration for PSBT creation, now with improved logging and error handling.

3. **Wallet Integration**: A more structured approach to wallet connection and transaction signing using the LaserEyes provider pattern.

4. **User Interface**: A responsive interface with improved component structure, styling with Tailwind CSS, and better user feedback.

## Recent Changes

The codebase has undergone a significant refactoring:

1. **Migration to Next.js**: The frontend has been migrated from Parcel to Next.js with TypeScript.

2. **Component Structure**: The application has been refactored into smaller, more focused components:
   - MintButton component for handling minting functionality
   - LaserEyesWrapper component for wallet integration
   - Proper separation of concerns between components

3. **Styling Approach**: The project now uses Tailwind CSS with a more structured CSS organization.

4. **Improved Error Handling**: Better error handling throughout the application with more specific error messages.

5. **Enhanced Development Workflow**: Concurrent running of frontend and backend, TypeScript for better type safety, and ESLint for code quality.

6. **Strict Wallet Requirements**: The application requires a fully compatible OYL wallet that supports PSBT signing and broadcasting:
   - No mock implementations or fallbacks for wallet functionality
   - Proper error handling for incompatible wallet versions
   - Clear error messages directing users to update their wallet if needed

## Next Steps

Based on the current state of the codebase, the following next steps are recommended:

1. **Complete SDK Integration**: Replace the mock implementation in `oyl-sdk-integration.js` with the actual OYL SDK integration.

2. **Further UI Improvements**: 
   - Replace alert dialogs with proper UI components for notifications
   - Add transaction history and status tracking
   - Enhance mobile responsiveness

3. **Error Handling Enhancements**: 
   - Implement a more comprehensive error handling strategy
   - Add error boundaries in React components
   - Improve error reporting and logging

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement rate limiting on the server
   - Add authentication for API requests
   - Enhance input validation

5. **Testing Implementation**:
   - Add unit tests for React components
   - Implement integration tests for the API
   - Set up end-to-end testing for the complete flow

6. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement code splitting and lazy loading
   - Optimize bundle size
   - Add caching strategies

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. Wallet Integration Strategy

The wallet integration has been improved with the LaserEyes provider pattern, which provides a more structured approach to wallet connection and transaction signing. Considerations include:

- Whether to enhance the current LaserEyes integration or explore alternative approaches
- How to handle different wallet versions and capabilities
- Strategies for fallback when certain wallet features are not available

### 2. Backend Implementation

The backend still uses a mock implementation instead of the actual OYL SDK integration. Decisions to be made include:

- Timeline for implementing the actual SDK integration
- Strategy for testing the real implementation
- How to ensure backward compatibility during the transition

### 3. Error Handling Strategy

While error handling has been improved, further enhancements are needed. Considerations include:

- Implementing a centralized error handling system
- Defining error categories and appropriate responses
- Balancing user-facing error messages with developer logging

### 4. User Experience Enhancements

The user experience has been improved but could be further enhanced. Considerations include:

- Adding more detailed transaction status updates
- Implementing a transaction history feature
- Enhancing the visual feedback during the minting process

### 5. Deployment Strategy

As the project moves closer to production readiness, deployment considerations include:

- Choosing appropriate hosting platforms for frontend and backend
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines
- Implementing monitoring and alerting
- Planning for scalability and reliability
